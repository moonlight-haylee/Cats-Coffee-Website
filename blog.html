                    <p>We have teamed up with animal shelters around the city to provide extra support and resources for the cats that are in need of a loving home.
                        Here, we will post updates on those who have been adopted and any new members that come to us who are looking for their forever home! 
                        After adoption, we always ask families to send us pictures of their new companions in their new homes to share our success stories and 
                        to demonstrate the impact you made in their lives!</p>

                                About two months ago, I went into the cafe and met this lovely cat named Stella. She immediately caught my attention because
                                she was so loving, playful and never left my side. I instantly fell in love. The adoption process was easy, since I don't own
                                any other pets, and ever since I brought her home she has been the best companion. She is so energetic, and having her by my
                                side has made my days brighter!

                                I know this probably sounds crazy, but I recently adopted my 6th cat. I also have 2 dogs who are so friendly to other dogs and 
                                cats. The process took much longer, due to the amound of pets I initially had. I asked the shop owner if I could possibly introduce
                                Fluffy to the dogs first, so I brought them in to get to know each other, then my cats one by one (on separate occasions) as we worked through 
                                this application. After I got them all introduced, I got the approval to take Fluffy home! Now, they're alll best buddies, and 
                                he fits right in with the group! Fluffy is the one on the far right, so he's still at a distance from them but he's gotten way 
                                more comfortable over the few months he's been home. Thank you!

                                It's been over a year since I adopted Stewart from this place, and he's definitely a character! When I first met him, he was a bit 
                                standoff-ish, but not agressive or anything. He just wasn't interested in anything, and I found it funny. He would kind of sit near me 
                                and stare me down, but wouldn't come to me. I always have my colleagues over for game night, or to just have a chat, and Stewart seems 
                                to be an intellectual. He's always interested in the cards we lay on the table or when we work on our computers. Like I said, what a character. xD
